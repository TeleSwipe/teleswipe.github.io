<h2 class="section-heading">Create a SVG Vector Graphic</h2>

I Have created a Illustration for my Website. The SpaceReactor. 
Thought, spend to much Time for this Illustration, but I'm not a Illustrator. This is how i have done these Info Graphics for my Website and Workflow.

The Point is, you are absolute free in the Illustrator and only what do you have to do is to save the graphis or Illustration to SVG, it Output a Text file with the SVG Code.
Copy it and inlcude it to your Html. Or what ever. Hope your Like it. Peace.
