<h2 class="section-heading"> Javascript Canvas - Math Code</h2>


Today i gonna show you, how write javascript for canvas and Webgl. 
I want to build a Animation in canvas (Javascript) and overlay it with a gradient Background colors. but, there is one thing about the <code> opacity</code>. How set the Gradient Background beetween the Javascript Particles and the Canvas Background. And the SpaceBall (Spacesphere) should turn left or right in a rotate x or y.  

Then i have writed in the Javascript, that the code should give out a div conatiner for the HTML of the Front Page. now, it's create a element "div" with a class "space-id"
<pre>
		container = document.createElement('div');
				container.setAttribute('class', 'space-id');
				document.body.appendChild(container);
</pre>


First i had created a animation with three.js the source code for the canvas. 
came up with this one.
